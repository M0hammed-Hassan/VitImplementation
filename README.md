# Vision Transformer Implementation
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for image classification tasks. The implementation includes both the model architecture and training pipeline, as well as scripts for training the model on a custom datasets.


My implementation follows the architecture described in this picture:

This my encoder architecture that i have implemented:
